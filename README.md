Everything in this repository is work that I have done at NYU in pursuit of a B.S. in Computer Engineering.

Classwork located in this repository from NYU Tandon:
<ul>
<li>CS 1134 - Data Structures and Algorithms (Python 2.x and 3.x)</li>
<li>CS 2124 - Object Oriented Programming (C++)</li>
<li>CS 3943 - Intro To Offensive Security (Graduate Level Course, uses C, Python(2/3), HTML/PHP/SQL, x86-64 Assembly, and Linux Shell Script)</li>
<li>EE 2204 - Digital Logic And State Machine Design (Xilinx Tools)</li>
</ul>

I am also part of NYU's Cyber Security Lab, the OSIRIS Lab, but that code is in my OSIRIS Repository.
