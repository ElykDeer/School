School

These are the classes that I have taken at NYU Tandon:
  CS 1134 - Data Structures and Algorithms (Python 2 and 3)

This is the class that I am currently taking:
  CS 2124 - Object Oriented Programming (C++)
  
  
In my current course, CS 2124, my teacher is greatly emphasising code readability - which was something I mildly was concerned about before, but never bothered with comments very much.  As a result, code before CS 2124 (including in my SnakeOS repo) often has very few comments.  All code written during CS 2124 and after will follow stricter readability standards.
