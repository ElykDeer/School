Everything in this repository is work that I have done at NYU in pursuit of a B.S. in Computer Engineering.

Classwork located in this repository from NYU Tandon:
<ul>
<li>CS 1134 - Data Structures and Algorithms (Python 2.x and 3.x)</li>
<li>CS 2124 - Object Oriented Programming (C++)</li>
</ul>

I am also part of the OSIRIS Lab, so I'm posting my personal code for the HackNight challenges.  I take part regularly in their CTF's, and anything I managed to contribute I post as well - still learning!
